Risk Assessment

Overall Risk Profile

The control analytics identified 214 total exceptions across three key risk categories:
	•	131 Approval Limit Breaches
	•	63 Potential Split Payments
	•	20 Duplicate Invoice Payments

The volume and distribution of exceptions indicate systemic control pressure rather than isolated anomalies.



Risk Severity Evaluation

Approval Limit Breaches — High Risk
	•	Represents the majority of exceptions.
	•	Indicates override or circumvention of delegated authority.
	•	Direct financial exposure risk.
	•	Signals potential policy enforcement weakness.

Risk Level: High
Impact: Financial misstatement / policy violation exposure


Potential Split Payments — Medium to High Risk
	•	Structured transactions may indicate threshold avoidance.
	•	Could reflect intentional control circumvention.
	•	Elevates fraud and audit scrutiny risk.

Risk Level: Medium–High
Impact: Compliance and fraud exposure

 Duplicate Invoice Payments — Medium Risk
	•	Indicates process breakdown in invoice matching.
	•	Creates direct financial leakage.
	•	Suggests AP automation or review gaps.

Risk Level: Medium
Impact: Operational loss risk



Risk Concentration Themes

The analysis revealed three structural risk drivers:
	1.	Departmental Risk Imbalance
Certain departments exhibit breach rates significantly above organizational average.
	2.	Vendor-Level Risk Concentration
A small number of vendors account for a disproportionate share of breach exposure.
	3.	Approval Threshold Misalignment
High-value transactions operating near or above approval limits increase override probability.



Control Maturity Assessment

Based on observed exception patterns:
	•	Preventative controls appear inconsistently enforced.
	•	Monitoring controls are reactive rather than continuous.
	•	Threshold structures may not reflect operational realities.

Overall control environment maturity: Moderate with elevated override risk exposure.



Recommended Control Enhancements
	1.	Implement automated real-time breach flagging.
	2.	Introduce vendor-level risk concentration thresholds.
	3.	Recalibrate approval limits based on transaction analytics.
	4.	Require secondary review for high-risk vendor payments.
	5.	Implement monthly control exception reporting to management.
