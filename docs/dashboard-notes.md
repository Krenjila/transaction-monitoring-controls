Dashboard Overview

Purpose

The Power BI dashboard translates transaction-level control testing into executive-ready risk intelligence.

It provides visibility into:
	•	Financial exposure
	•	Control breach concentration
	•	Departmental risk patterns
	•	Vendor-level risk clustering
	•	Approval threshold alignment

The objective is to enable continuous monitoring rather than reactive review.

Dashboard Structure

The dashboard is structured to tell a risk story from macro to micro:
	1.	Enterprise Exposure (KPI Layer)
	2.	Department-Level Risk
	3.	Control Breach vs Spend Relationship
	4.	Threshold Alignment Analysis
	5.	Vendor Risk Concentration

⸻

Executive KPIs

Displayed at the top of the dashboard:
	•	Total Spend
	•	Total Transactions
	•	Total Breach Amount

These provide immediate context on:
	•	Scale of financial operations
	•	Volume-driven exposure
	•	Absolute exception magnitude

This allows executives to understand materiality before diving into breakdowns.

1. Breach % by Department

What It Shows

The percentage of total spend classified as breach-related by department.

Why It Matters

Raw breach amounts can mislead when departments operate at different spending levels.

Normalizing breach exposure by total spend:
	•	Identifies systemic control weaknesses
	•	Enables fair cross-department comparison
	•	Highlights units requiring audit attention

Insight

Marketing demonstrates the highest breach rate (~72%), indicating elevated control failure exposure relative to activity.

⸻

2. Control Breaches vs Total Spend by Department

What It Shows

Side-by-side comparison of:
	•	Total spend
	•	Total breach amount

Why It Matters

This visual tests whether breach exposure scales proportionally with spending volume.

Insight

Higher spend departments show elevated breach totals, but breach magnitude does not scale uniformly.
This suggests process inefficiencies beyond pure transaction volume.

⸻

3. Spending vs Approval Threshold Alignment

What It Shows

Average transaction amount plotted against average approval limit by department.

Why It Matters

When transaction sizes approach approval thresholds:
	•	Override risk increases
	•	Policy friction intensifies
	•	Control effectiveness declines

Insight

Certain departments operate close to their delegated authority limits, increasing approval override risk.

4. Vendor Risk Concentration (Top 5 Vendors)

What It Shows

Bubble chart of:
	•	Total Spend (X-axis)
	•	Total Breach Amount (Y-axis)
	•	Transaction Volume (Bubble Size)
	•	Vendor Name (Legend)
Why It Matters

Risk is often vendor-concentrated rather than evenly distributed across the organization.
Department-level summaries can obscure exposure that originates from a small number of external counterparties.

This visualization highlights:
	•	Vendors with high breach amounts relative to spend
	•	Vendors with large transaction volumes increasing exposure surface
	•	Outliers where breach severity is disproportionate

Key Observations
	•	One vendor exhibits disproportionately high breach amount relative to spend, indicating elevated control failure risk.
	•	A small group of vendors accounts for a majority of total breach exposure.
	•	High-volume vendors amplify operational risk even when breach rates appear moderate.

Control Implication

Monitoring should include:
	•	Vendor-level breach thresholds
	•	Enhanced due diligence for high-risk vendors
	•	Periodic review of vendor approval workflows
	•	Concentration risk reporting in audit dashboards

Vendor analytics transforms this from a departmental issue into a counterparty risk management problem.
