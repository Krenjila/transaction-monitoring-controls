🛡 Transaction Monitoring & Internal Controls Framework

Overview

This project simulates a transaction-level monitoring system designed to detect control failures, approval threshold violations, and vendor concentration risk using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

The objective is to move from periodic review to continuous risk monitoring.



System Architecture
	•	Python → Synthetic transaction data generation
	•	SQL → Control breach detection + summary views
	•	Power BI → Executive monitoring dashboard



Key Risk Metrics
	•	Total Spend: $1.64M
	•	Total Breach Amount: $1.09M
	•	214 Transactions
	•	Breach rate across departments: 63–72%



Control Logic

A breach is defined as:

Transaction Amount > Approval Limit

Additional risk concentration analysis performed at:
	•	Department level
	•	Vendor level

Dashboard Insights

1. Department Risk Exposure
<img src="powerbi/breach-by-department.png" width="700">
Story:
	•	Marketing shows the highest breach percentage (~72%).
	•	Risk exposure is not evenly distributed across departments.
	•	Control weakness appears systemic rather than isolated.

Implication:
Internal audit should prioritize departments with elevated breach rates.


2. Control Breaches vs Spend
<img src="powerbi/controlbreach-totalspent.png" width="700">
Story:
	•	Higher spend departments correlate with higher total breach amounts.
	•	Marketing and Operations drive the majority of financial risk.
	•	IT shows lower total exposure relative to spend.

Implication:
High transaction volume increases exposure to control failures.


3. Spending vs Approval Threshold
<img src="powerbi/spending-approval.png" width="700">
Story:
	•	Some departments operate closer to their approval limits.
	•	Large average transaction sizes paired with high approval thresholds increase override risk.
	•	Outliers indicate potential policy misalignment.

Implication:
Approval thresholds may need recalibration in certain departments


4. Vendor Risk Concentration
<img src="powerbi/vendor-risk-concentration.png" width="700">
Story:
	•	Risk is concentrated among a small group of vendors.
	•	One vendor shows disproportionately high breach amount relative to spend.
	•	Vendor-level monitoring reveals exposure invisible at department level.

Implication:
Risk is vendor-concentrated, not just department-driven.


⸻

Business Implications
	•	High breach concentration suggests weak preventive controls
	•	Vendor-level clustering indicates dependency risk
	•	Certain departments show threshold proximity patterns

⸻

Future Enhancements
	•	Risk scoring model
	•	Anomaly detection using statistical thresholds
	•	Automated exception flagging pipeline
